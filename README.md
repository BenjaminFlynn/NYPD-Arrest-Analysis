   - Identify the total amount of arrests.
   - Examine the frequency of arrests over time.

2. **Understand demographic patterns**:
   - Break down arrest data by age, gender, and race.
   - Explore disparities in arrests across demographic groups.

3. **Communicate insights**:
   - Use interactive Tableau dashboards to present findings.
   - Enable stakeholders to explore the data visually and intuitively.
