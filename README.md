## Introduction

The NYPD publishes annual arrest data that includes demographic details, offenses, and other contextual information. This project aims to leverage this data to analyze arrest trends, focusing on the reasons behind arrests and how they vary across different demographic groups.

## Project Objectives

1. **Analyze arrest trends**:
   - Identify the most common offenses leading to arrests.
   - Examine the frequency of arrests by borough and precinct.

2. **Understand demographic patterns**:
   - Break down arrest data by age, gender, race, and ethnicity.
   - Explore disparities in arrests across demographic groups.

3. **Communicate insights**:
   - Use interactive Tableau dashboards to present findings.
   - Enable stakeholders to explore the data visually and intuitively.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Downloaded the NYPD Arrest Data for 2024.
2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed duplicate or incomplete entries.
   - Standardized formats for dates, names, and codes using SQL queries.
3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Conducted exploratory queries in SQL to uncover trends and patterns.
   - Aggregated data to understand arrest counts by demographic and location.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Imported processed data into Tableau.
   - Designed dashboards to display:
     - Arrests by borough and precinct.
     - Arrests broken down by demographic groups.
     - Distribution of offenses.
5. **Insights and Reporting**:
   - Highlighted key findings and trends.
   - Suggested actionable recommendations for policymakers.

## Visualizations

The following dashboards are included in the Tableau workbook:

1. **Arrest Trends by Borough**: Displays total arrests and trends over time.
2. **Demographics Breakdown**: Interactive charts showing arrests by age, race, gender, and ethnicity.
3. **Offense Analysis**: Highlights the most common reasons for arrests.
4. **Precinct-Level Analysis**: Zoomed-in views of arrest data by NYPD precincts.
